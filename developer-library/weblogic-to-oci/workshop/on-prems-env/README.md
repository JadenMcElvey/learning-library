# Setup an 'on-premises' environment

## Introduction: 

For this migration workshop, we need an environment to migrate from.

We're offering 2 ways to provision this environment:

- Using a demo Marketplace image for this workshop.
- Using locally on your development machine, using Docker

Both paths provide a pre-packaged 'on-premises' simulated environment which includes an Application Database and a WebLogic domain including 2 web applications and a datasource to connect to the database.

The Marketplace image deployment is simpler and faster, while the Docker environment provides a way to more realistically simulate an 'on-premises' environment as it runs on your local machine.

Chose one or the other:

- [On-premises environment using Marketplace image](?lab=lab-2-option-setup-on-premises-environment)
- [On-premises environment using Docker](?lab=lab-2-option-b-setup-local-(on-premises))
