## Introduction

*Describe the lab in one or two sentences, for example:* This lab walks you through the steps to ...

Estimated Lab Time: &lt;n&gt; minutes

### About Product/Technology
Enter background information here..

### Objectives

*List objectives for the lab - if this is the intro lab, list objectives for the workshop*

In this lab, you'll:
* Objective 1
* Objective 2
* Objective 3

### Prerequisites

*Use this section to describe any prerequisites, including Oracle Cloud accounts, set up requirements, etc.*

* Item no 1
* Item no 2 with url - [URL Text](https://www.oracle.com).

*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## **STEP 1**: title

Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Code examples - test pattern for `< and >` characters

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a <variable> using the less-than and greater-than symbols</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a &lt;variable&gt; that uses the escaped characters</copy>
    ```

3. Sample inline image that is 100 x 100 pixels ![100x100](images/sample3.png) (max size for an in-line image)

4. Image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

5. 1200 pixel wide Image with a title.

    ![Image alt text](images/cloud-login.png " ")

6. 1200 pixel wide Image without a title (no " ")

    ![Image alt text](images/cloud-login.png)

7. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

8. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## **STEP 2:** title

1. Sub step 1

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples - test pattern for `< and >` characters

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a <variable> using the less-than and greater-than symbols</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a &lt;variable&gt; that uses the escaped characters</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

  To include `<` and `>` in your code fragments, use ``&lt;`` and ``&gt;`` to escape the characters in the code block:

	```
  <copy>ssh -i &lt;ssh-key-file&gt;</copy>
  ```

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may proceed to the next lab.
